## About the Project
In the Asian subcontinent, there are still many things that women are unable to do. Especially in small cities and villages, they are even unable to run a business but thanks to digitalization they are getting some platforms to start something, be it content creation or running a small-scale business. When it comes to small businesses they are unable to thrive because of the competition they are getting from large-scale businesses. After covid, most businesses have shifted online and it had also impacted women entrepreneurs hailing from small towns and cities. To tackle this issue we came up with the idea of Enterpreneur'Her. We provide a safer community for women and girls where they can sell their products, get analysis of the sale, communicate, get mentored, and shine like a pro-enterprenurThis application was inspired by women worldwide who were unable to shine their small-scale business idea because of the unhealthy competition out there.
